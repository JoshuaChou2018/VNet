# VNet

**MSc. Thesis** - *3D Convolutional Neural Network for Liver Tumor Segmentation*

Implementation of Deep Learning and Computer Vision for Liver Tumor Segmentation, using the [LiTS Dataset](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094#participate "LiTS - Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge")

# What I Learned

* Pre-processed Medical Images in the NIfTI format with NiBabel, SciPy
* Adapted [VNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04797 "V-Net: Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation") (3D CNN Architecture) to Tensorflow/Keras
